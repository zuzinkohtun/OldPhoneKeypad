# OldPhoneKeypad
### 1. About the project
This project simulates text for an old mobile phone keypad, where multiple button presses represent different characters. It interprets input strings composed of digits, spaces, backspace (*), and a send key (#), then outputs the corresponding text message. Itâ€™s useful for demonstrating input parsing, control flow, and state management in C#.
